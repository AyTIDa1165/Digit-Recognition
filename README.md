# MNIST Digit Recognition Using PCA and QDA
A simple Machine Learning Model that classifies handwritten digits (from 0 to 9) using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) for classification. Two different approaches are explored: one without PCA and another with PCA applied before QDA. The performance of the classifiers is evaluated based on overall accuracy and per-label accuracy. The two approaches in the ML model yield an overall recognition accuracy upto 85.72% and 92.67% respectively.
