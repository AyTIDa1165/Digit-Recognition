# MNIST Digit Recognition Using PCA and QDA
A simple Machine Learning Model that classifies handwritten digits (from 0 to 9) using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) for classification. Two different approaches are explored: one without PCA and another with PCA applied before QDA. The performance of the classifiers is evaluated based on overall accuracy and per-label accuracy. The best recognition accuracy attained by the ML model is upto 92.67%
